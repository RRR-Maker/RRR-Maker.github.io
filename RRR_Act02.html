						  	  	<p>This short film, a play for four voice actors, is an experiment with excerpted definitions and discussions of dirt, soil, and compost, personifying these entities and highlighting their 	interrelationships. Snippets of found and re-assembled text accompany a video of a garden, my compost pile, and my small forest/mushroom farm. Many of the lines excerpted here were taken directly from the online Cambridge English Dictionary or were written by gardeners. I also include the claim from an online academic essay, written by Omar Lizzardo (a cognitive linguist) and a short snippet of “Ode to Dirt,” a poem by Sharon Olds.</p>
								
								<p>My goal with this assemblage is to illustrate how everyday definitions (in English) of natural and/or non-human objects remove agency and human entanglement from the descriptions they offer. A striking number of online definitions overtly refer to dirt as “dead.” The online Cambridge Dictionary defines dirt as, “dust, soil, or any substance that makes a surface not clean.” Whereas soil is “the material on the surface of the ground in which plants grow” and compost is “decaying plant material that is added to soil to improve its quality.” Only by comparing terms do we see how they are inter-reliant: Soil often encompasses dirt. Compost is a process &mdash; set in motion by humans &mdash; which enriches soil. More pointedly, typical definitions of dirt, soil, and compost absent any relationship to humankind and remove the potential for agency or sovereignty.</p>
									
								<p> Lizzardo’s approach to dirt takes up the metaphoric, and so cultural, nature of definitions, reminding us that <em>definitions and the distinctions they carry are never culturally neutral. Through metaphor, semantic emphasis, and rhetorical framing even simple definitions can be stealthily layered with value systems</em>. He writes, “much of our conceptualization and reasoning about moral propriety is framed by a set of metaphors that originate from a conceptual structure generated from our experiences with dirt and cleanliness.” We might argue similarly that definitions of dirt, soil, and compost do more than metaphorically reify the separation of humans from the natural world, its messy interconnections, and its interreliant processes–these definitions also absolve humans of the responsibilities arising from our inter-relationship to the natural world. If dirt is dead, we can ignore it, dismiss it, or avoid it.</p>
							
								<p>In “the language of animacy,” Robin Wall Kimmerer writes:</p>
									
								<p style="margin-left: 50px;">In English, we never refer to a member of our family, or indeed to any person, as it. That would be a profound act of disrespect. It robs a person of selfhood and kinship, reducing a person to a mere thing. So it is that in Potawatomi and most other indigenous languages, we use the same words to address the living world as we use for our family. Because they are our family. (402)</p>
							
								<p>Rhetoricians, such as Thomas Rickert, have argued similarly, troubling the “subject-object” boundaries central to western rhetoric and recognizing the relational nature of environments, the objects within them, and humans. Rickert’s rhetorical framework reestablishes the non-human agency of the natural world, its beings and entities:</p>
								
								<p style="margin-left: 50px;">World may be world for human beings, insofar as it is exceedingly difficult to extricate ourselves from the world that already takes part in who and how we are, but it does not depend on us, for it emerges from everything we do amid everything else that is&#8230; That is, things do not require human being; they have their own being and relations independent of all human categories&#8230; Thus, nonhuman entities and forces, in their own particular ways and guises, participate in the distribution of the materiality and energy that constitute the world. (221-222)</p>
								
								<p>Historians, scholars, and spiritual leaders have named our era the &ldquo;Anthropocene,&rdquo; a term that describes the significant impact of humans and human activity upon the earth. Our impact is now irreversible, say climatologists, geologists, and biologists. Planetary-wide natural systems have broken down; wide-scale climate change is unfolding year-by-year; there is dramatic decline in biodiversity; and profound degradation of local ecosystems, particularly the conditions that sustain healthy soil.</p>
								
								<p>Our language and rhetorical practices clearly participate in this deadening of our planet and its constituencies.&nbsp; As human connection is removed, definitions of dirt and soil underscore the ways that humans conceive of themselves as not only separate from or dominant over the natural world, but also without role in or responsibility to the processes that create, sustain, and enhance life on planet earth. How might a shift in language and rhetorical practice work side-by-side with efforts to reimagine our relationships to our topsoil, our eco-systems, and each other?</p>
