					  			<p>&ldquo;Assemblages are inherently productive, entering into polyvalent becomings to produce and give expression to previously nonexistent realities, thoughts, bodies, affects, spaces, actions, ideas, and so on&rdquo; (Weheliye 46).</p>
						
								<p>This assemblage of footage and mixed media plays on a much older artistic and rhetorical tradition: that of the palimpsest. A palimpsest is a layering technique where written work is continually built upon with &ldquo;newer,&rdquo; revised, or all-together different compositions while the older, &ldquo;original&rdquo; work remains visible. The opening words, which serve as an origin point for artistic work, are layered and entwined with one another. The collage of layered media presented here (the paragraphs and quotes taken from this Artist Statement as well as the collection of images, bodies, sounds, and narrations through camera lenses, audio clips, and cellphone footage is assembled or collected in the video/essay) is meant to replicate the palimpsest showcasing the important interconnected and multidimensional network of stepping&rsquo;s marking of time and percussive corporeality.</p>

								<p>The body, especially for many Black people, has its own way of languaging time and meaning &mdash; connecting time to our lived realities in ways that simultaneously express urgency and give space for reflection. Our arms, hands, mouth, feet, chest, tongue, thighs re/produces messages that harken back to specific times and important social movements, confront past histories, and reconcile additional layered meanings into our daily existence. The adornment of the body, too, our hair, clothes, shoes, etc. serve as part of the corporeal rhetorical network dictating time as part of our narrative. Our bodies are never neutral; it can be text, discourse, and social practice. Each stomp, clap, chest thump, grunt, suicide fall, and &ldquo;mean-muggin&rdquo; face is an embodied and performative paralexical &ldquo;word&rdquo; that means something. &ldquo;Definitionally, parlexical refers to the things that are adjacent to lexicon and grammar; things like sounds (such as beatboxing) that are not quite words but are still apart of communicating meaning within a sentence or specific moment of interpersonal communication [&#8230; paralexical &ldquo;words&rdquo;] are concocted words that create and replicate meaning radiating from the bodily experience or emotion&rdquo; (McGee 126-27). Through this interpretation of language, we can understand step (dancing) as a performative venue for communication. Black folks have communicated resistance, liberation, and joy through our bodies and beyond <em>just</em> words which, in turn, asserts our agency and temporality (or long-established existence) as being more than capable of not only surviving but thriving at times in oppressive environments. The clips of Black bodies stepping on a stage at a concert, at a probate on campus, and in the newsroom showcases the body&rsquo;s ability to work media and affix gazes upon the body en/forcing spectators to see us &ldquo;take up space&rdquo; in meaningful, resistive ways.</p>
						  	    
						 		<p>This work aims to highlight the relationship of temporality and corporeality while centering Black rhetorics and ways of thinking. This work&rsquo;s primary focus isn&rsquo;t about highlighting the different attitudes, philosophies, or even so much about the histories of the evolution of Black women&rsquo;s social clubs and their contemporary iterations of Greek life. It isn&rsquo;t about self-promotion or competition. I am wanting to tie together the rhetorical sense of temporality (as it is communicated by/through stepping) as a means of claiming agency in and through the body (with and without the traditional understanding of &quot;words&quot;). The artistic work is meant to illuminate how Black rhetorics weave a network of resistance through establishing a community, engaging in call-and-response, and cultivating spaces to be unapologetically Black in times where Black bodies are often de/valued via assemblage. In simpler terms, it is intended to demonstrate how types of public media can act or reverberate through the body and rhetorically signal the need for social action–be that as critique or celebration, camaraderie or competition, care and consideration.</p>
						
						  		<p>Rhetoricians and Black Studies scholars alike have taken the body up as a theoretical and physical medium in which to necessitate recognition of the body&rsquo;s humanity and the social conditions imposed upon one&rsquo;s agency-making abilities. More importantly, the body is the centralizing text that has the ability to inform relationships of meaning through specific kinds of sociocultural and symbolic language. While Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) can view relationships of meaning from the top down (van Dijk), this work spotlights how CDA can be implemented from the ground-level up and how grassroot movements inform higher social powers like the influence of international superstar Beyoncé.</p>
