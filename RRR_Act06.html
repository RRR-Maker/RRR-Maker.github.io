						  		<p>In <em>Rhetorics of Motherhood</em> (which, coincidentally, was published soon after I became a mother), Lindal Buchanan argues that the rhetorical figure of &ldquo;The Mother not only encourages identification and a predetermined emotional response but also discourages critical distance, in effect shutting down analysis, discussion, deliberation, reflection, and nuance&rdquo; (7). In this project, I bring the tools of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to texts about motherhood in order to perform this gap between emotional identification and critical analysis. In particular, I draw attention to contradictions in the messages women receive about motherhood, work, and balance. As a professional academic who is also a mother, I have experienced what Lynne O&rsquo;Brien and Andrea O&rsquo;Reilly describe as &ldquo;Contemporary women&rsquo;s subjectivity&#8230; split between newfound gains as unencumbered women (women without children) and old gendered expectations when women become mothers&rdquo; (6). I chose to represent this split subjectivity multimodally by juxtaposing advice given to working mothers with demands placed on women by employers and family.</p>
						
					  		  	<p>In this video, the central figure of Working Mother/Mothering Worker (MW) delivers an address remixed from two popular media articles that offer practical advice to working mothers even as their titles indicate some ambivalence: &ldquo;How to Be Mostly O.K. (and Occasionally Fantastic) at the Whole Working Mom Thing&rdquo; (Brody) and &ldquo;Is This the Moment When Working Moms Finally &lsquo;Have It All&rsquo;? Not Exactly&rdquo; (Saujani). My remix highlights the authors&rsquo; use of imperatives (&ldquo;Use your commute.&rdquo; &ldquo;the rest of us&#8230;have to speak out.&rdquo;), which contrasts their optimistic, friendly tone. Paradoxically, this rhetorical approach puts more of a burden on working moms by making them responsible for their own liberation, an idea I represent visually through MW being handed a constant stream of items while she speaks.</p>
						
					  		  	<p>MW&rsquo;s passionate call to action is largely undermined by the other participants in the video. Two actors embody four generic figures who affect MW&rsquo;s ability to follow her own advice: Dad (MW&rsquo;s partner/co-parent), &ldquo;Supportive&rdquo; Employer (SE), Kid (MW&rsquo;s child/children), and Demanding Boss (DB). In order to reveal the types of rhetoric that working mothers must parse in their daily lives, each of these participants uses one specific form of discourse.</p>
						
					  		  	<p>The two &ldquo;home&rdquo; figures, Dad and Kid, demonstrate direct and indirect speech acts. Kid uses interrogation to make seemingly straightforward demands (&ldquo;Can I have a snack?&rdquo;), but every question conceals an imperative, a demand being placed on MW (&ldquo;Get me a snack.&rdquo;). Dad&rsquo;s speech acts primarily take the form of declarative assertions of fact (&ldquo;The kids are asking for a snack.&rdquo;), but they also contain indirect imperatives (&ldquo;Get the kids a snack.&rdquo;). The implied message here (that MW is unable to keep up with home demands) relies on the viewer&rsquo;s presupposition that a good mother is responsible for the well-being of her husband and children. When they ask a question or make a statement, she is expected to respond.</p>
						
					  		  	<p>The two &ldquo;work&rdquo; figures, &ldquo;Supportive&rdquo; Employer (SE) and Demanding Boss (DB), use imperatives and different modalities to demonstrate the contradictory ways employers address work-life balance. DB uses imperatives and high modality (&ldquo;We need you to&#8230;&rdquo;), revealing the power differential between boss and employee and the difficulty, perhaps even impossibility, of following MW&rsquo;s optimistic advice. SE uses indirect speech acts that offer permission rather than issuing a command (&ldquo;You can&#8230;&rdquo;). Initially, there appears to be a difference in the deontic modality of these two speakers, or the extent to which the employer believes they can compel the employee (Machin and Mayr 190). However, the seemingly low modality of SE&rsquo;s statements disguises the actual power differential. Machin and Mayr point out that &ldquo;Certain modals also have a function in concealing power relations&#8230; a speaker can use this to build up a sense of power while at the same time being able to deny it&rdquo; (190). The video contrasts the two employers with each other, and with MW&rsquo;s advice, to demonstrate that offers such as &ldquo;six weeks of unpaid leave&rdquo; are not true offers of flexibility, but instead demonstrations of the control employers have over employees.</p>
						  		
					  		  	<p>In creating this video, I drew heavily on my personal experiences as well as those of women I know (it is not a coincidence that the protagonist shares my initials). In combining public and private rhetorics, I attempt to bring to light issues that are under-theorized yet have tangible effects on many people&rsquo;s lives. Buchanan argues that &ldquo;The Mother&rsquo;s persuasive force&rdquo; can be both dangerous and extremely effective in terms of &ldquo;its capacity to stir emotion and inspire trust, and its ability to encourage acquiescence and mute critique and reflection&rdquo; (7). I hope that my embodied portrayal of MW in this video will stir viewers&rsquo; emotion while using CDA to amplify, rather than mute, critique and reflection.</p>
